## My process

### Built with

This was build with base front-end technologies and approaches including:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology for styles

### What I learned

The task was more for practicing what was already learned in the previous challenges. I tried to add a little animation on card hovering and the interesting for me was pseudo element stack order.
