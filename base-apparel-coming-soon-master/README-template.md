## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology for styles

### What I learned

This challenge was especially useful for practising how to position hero image that takes the whole width in mobile and the whole height in desktop view. There's need to research more about that...

It was as well useful for refreshing the knoledge of html form and input elements and trying some basic form validation with JS.

### Useful resources

While building my solution I found very useful:
- [Email form validation with JS](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je) - got some ideas from here.
- [Introduction to `input` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) - refered to it for recollecting how to use input field.
