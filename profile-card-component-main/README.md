## Summary

The aim of the challenge is to recreate the [given design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) as close as possible with the aim of the front end technologies. Here it is a profile card component that I choose to practice my HTML and Sass coding skills and to improve code structuring abilities.

## Technologies

HTML5, Sass

## What I learned

This little project was very useful for exploring the existing rules for writing CSS. It was my first try to use BEM approach and to create partial Sass files. I found it challenging to position multiple background images set with `background-image`.
