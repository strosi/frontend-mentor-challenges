## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The challenge was very useful for practicing how to:
- generate new colors with built-in modules and
- define custom functions in Sass.  

I played with transition effects to add a little interactivity in desktop view.
