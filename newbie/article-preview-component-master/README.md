### Built with

This little piece of work was build with base front-end technologies and approaches including:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology for styles

### What I learned

It was interesting to learn how to build accessible tooltip and to read about ARIA attributes. I had to recollect JS for haven't written in it for a while.

### Useful resources

Links I used while googling about accessible tooltip:
- [Information about some ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tooltip_role)
- [Thoughts on how to create tooltip](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-tooltips/)
- [Tooltip example](https://codepen.io/emoyal4/pen/vYJWjKv) - Took a hint from here for the JS code.
