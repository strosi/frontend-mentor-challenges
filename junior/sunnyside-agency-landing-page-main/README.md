## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

In this challenge:
- Worked a little more on CSS animations;
- Used `requestAnimationFrame()` method to activate animation on entering the viewport.

### Time to complete

- HTML -> 1 h and more (that includes the time for thinking of the hierarchy of elements, proper BEM class names and adjusting the code while writing the CSS);
- Sass -> 13 h (that includes thinking of responsive design from mobile to desktop, thinking of the mobile menu transition effect only with `transform` property, resolving some problems with resizing svg icons and so on);
- Animation (CSS, JS) -> 5 h (half of the time was devoted to the header animation...)

## Acknowledgments
