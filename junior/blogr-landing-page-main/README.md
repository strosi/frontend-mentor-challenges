## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The new for me in this challenge was the creation of submenus and checking if menu button is clicked with the `isEqualNode()` method of the Node interface.

### Time to complete

It took more than 15 hours... That includes:
- setting up the HTML and thinking of proper class names (about an hour).
- mobile view styles (4 hours).
- creating mobile menu and transform it to desktop menu on resize (about 3 hours).
- adjusting the layout to match the provided design (7 hours).
