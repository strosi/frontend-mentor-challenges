## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) - React library

### What I learned

This simple app was great for practising React. I tried for the first time React Transition Group and fetching data from an API.
I learned to:
- embed React in existing HTML document without `creat-react-app`,
- use the React Transition Group library to add transition effect to some elements.

### Useful resources

- [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) - Here I found how to include React in existing page.
- [How to Add Animations with React Transition Group](https://blog.openreplay.com/how-to-add-animations-with-react-transition-group) - Useful React Transition Group introduction.
- [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) - This helped me setting up CSSTransition and used the link in the HTML to access the library externally.


### Time to complete
Aproximatly 6h including:
- setting up HTML (15 min),
- setting up styles (1h 30m),
- React (more than 3h) - searching how to embed React code in existing page took me a lot of the time,
- React Transition Group (about an hour).
