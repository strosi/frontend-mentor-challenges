## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Fetch API
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to pay more attention to the 'name' attribute of radio buttons of different groups and to be careful to what element an event listener is attached. I've got a lot of truble with that...

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
